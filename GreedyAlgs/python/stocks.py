Writing programming interview questions hasn't made me rich yet ... so I might give up and start trading Apple stocks all day instead.

First, I wanna know how much money I could have made yesterday if I'd been trading Apple stocks all day.

So I grabbed Apple's stock prices from yesterday and put them in a list called stock_prices, where:

The indices are the time (in minutes) past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price (in US dollars) of one share of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, that means stock_prices[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices and returns the best profit I could have made from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple stock yesterday.

For example:

  stock_prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

get_max_profit(stock_prices)
# Returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

Python 3.6
No "shorting"—you need to buy before you can sell. Also, you can't buy and sell in the same time step—at least 1 minute has to pass.

def get_max_profit(stock_prices):
    if len(stock_prices) < 2:
        raise ValueError('Getting a profit requires at least 2 prices')

    # We'll greedily update min_price and max_profit, so we initialize
    # them to the first price and the first possible profit
    min_price  = stock_prices[0]
    max_profit = stock_prices[1] - stock_prices[0]

    # Start at the second (index 1) time
    # We can't sell at the first time, since we must buy first,
    # and we can't buy and sell at the same time!
    # If we started at index 0, we'd try to buy *and* sell at time 0.
    # This would give a profit of 0, which is a problem if our
    # max_profit is supposed to be *negative*--we'd return 0.
    for current_time in range(1, len(stock_prices)):
        current_price = stock_prices[current_time]

        # See what our profit would be if we bought at the
        # min price and sold at the current price
        potential_profit = current_price - min_price

        # Update max_profit if we can do better
        max_profit = max(max_profit, potential_profit)

        # Update min_price so it's always
        # the lowest price we've seen so far
        min_price  = min(min_price, current_price)

    return max_profit
