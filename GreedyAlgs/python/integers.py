You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.

Write a function get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index() that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the products.

For example, given:

  [1, 7, 3, 4]

Python 3.6
your function would return:

  [84, 12, 28, 21]

Python 3.6
by calculating:

  [7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]

Python 3.6
Here's the catch: You can't use division in your solution!


def get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index(int_list):

    if len(int_list) < 2:
        raise IndexError('Getting the product of numbers at other '
                         'indices requires at least 2 numbers')

    # We make a list with the length of the input list to
    # hold our products
    products_of_all_ints_except_at_index = [None] * len(int_list)

    # For each integer, we find the product of all the integers
    # before it, storing the total product so far each time
    product_so_far = 1
    for i in range(len(int_list)):
        products_of_all_ints_except_at_index[i] = product_so_far
        product_so_far *= int_list[i]

    # For each integer, we find the product of all the integers
    # after it. since each index in products already has the
    # product of all the integers before it, now we're storing
    # the total product of all other integers
    product_so_far = 1
    for i in range(len(int_list) - 1, -1, -1):
        products_of_all_ints_except_at_index[i] *= product_so_far
        product_so_far *= int_list[i]

    return products_of_all_ints_except_at_index
