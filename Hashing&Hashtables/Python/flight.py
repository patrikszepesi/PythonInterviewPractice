You've built an inflight entertainment system with on-demand movie streaming.

Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their first one ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands before they can see the ending. So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose total runtimes will equal the exact flight length.

Write a function that takes an integer flight_length (in minutes) and a list of integers movie_lengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating whether there are two numbers in movie_lengths whose sum equals flight_length.

When building your function:

Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
Optimize for runtime over memory


def can_two_movies_fill_flight(movie_lengths, flight_length):
    # Movie lengths we've seen so far
    movie_lengths_seen = set()

    for first_movie_length in movie_lengths:
        matching_second_movie_length = flight_length - first_movie_length
        if matching_second_movie_length in movie_lengths_seen:
            return True
        movie_lengths_seen.add(first_movie_length)

    # We never found a match, so return False
    return False
